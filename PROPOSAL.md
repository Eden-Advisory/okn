# Development of a Comprehensive Financial Market Data Ontology and Graph Map

## Project Description:
The primary aim of this project is to develop a comprehensive financial market data ontology and graph map that facilitates the integration and analysis of complex financial data across various stakeholders. This proposal outlines the project's objectives, research and development approach, partnerships and engagement, collaboration plan, deliverables and management, evaluation, scalability, extensibility and sustainability, and data/AI ethics standards.

### Integrative Sociotechnical Research and Development:
The project integrates sociotechnical research and development methodologies to identify and analyze the financial market data ontology and graph map requirements. The research component comprises an extensive literature review, interviews with industry experts, and stakeholder analysis to understand the data structures, relationships, and terminologies in the financial markets. The development component employs agile software development practices to iteratively design, develop, and validate the ontology and graph map in collaboration with relevant stakeholders.

### Partnerships and Engagement:
Our team will collaborate with financial institutions, regulatory bodies, academia, and technology companies to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the market data ecosystem. We will engage with these partners through a series of workshops, focus group discussions, and joint working sessions. These interactions will foster knowledge exchange, refine the project requirements, and validate the developed ontology and graph map.

### Collaboration Plan:
To ensure effective collaboration, the team will adopt project management tools like Discord and GitHub. Regular meetings will be conducted to review progress, discuss challenges, and make necessary adjustments. We will also create a project advisory board comprising representatives from partnering organizations, who will provide strategic guidance, monitor project progress, and ensure alignment with stakeholder needs.

### Deliverables Plan:
The primary deliverables include a comprehensive financial market data ontology, a graph map, and accompanying documentation that adhere to the following technical requirements:

1. Common representation: All information will be represented using the Resource Description Framework (RDF) or a similar format to ensure interoperability.

2. Public/open access: The project's software and code for data ingestion, enrichment, query, and other key functions will be made publicly available on GitHub.

3. Standards-based approach: The graph data will be described using standard languages such as Web Ontology Language (OWL), Resource Description Framework Schema (RDFS), and Shapes Constraint Language (SHACL) schema.

4. Publicly documented schema: The schema will be publicly documented, including an actionable serialization (e.g., RDF/XML, TTL, JSON-LD) for transmission or storage.

5. Simple mappings: The project will establish simple (1-1) mappings of classes and properties within the graph data to entities in open systems like Wikidata, DBpedia, public graph data from the NSF's Convergence Accelerator Track A efforts, Google Data Commons, and other similar publicly accessible graph data sources.

6. Entity disambiguation: The project will provide entity disambiguation using entities from publicly accessible graph data sources and present the results in open, documented forms (e.g., OWL or RDF).

7. Complex mappings: When necessary, the project will employ complex mappings to large publicly accessible graph data sources using OWL or Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL).

8. Quality assurance: The project will ensure quality assurance of both the schema and entity mappings at increasing levels of complexity, providing open access to the methods and results.

9. Query capability: The project will enable querying the graph, e.g., using the public Simple Protocol and RDF Query Language (SPARQL) endpoint or similar capability.

10. Federated querying: The project will support federated querying using data from other Proto-OKN projects based on simple (1-1) mappings of classes and properties.

Additional elements covered in the proposal:

- Identified key public datasets for creating underlying knowledge graphs, with data from multiple sources and types.

- Ethical implications and data governance considerations, adhering to data and AI ethics standards, including Executive Order 13960 and OSTP Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights.

- Collaborations with other projects in the program, outlining areas and methods of collaboration.

- Roles and responsibilities of various constituents, ensuring the long-term maintenance of the project's information infrastructure.

- Data and software artifacts, including tools, data workflows, ontology, and knowledge design and implementation methods for creating the underlying knowledge graph infrastructure and semantically linking datasets.
